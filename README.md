# ðŸ“± Travel-Itinerary

**Travel-Itinerary** is a mobile-focused UI project created as part of an assignment to demonstrate Figma-to-code conversion skills.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

The goal of this assignment is to translate a complex Figma design into a responsive and pixel-accurate mobile UI. The Figma file only includes a **mobile view**, so the implementation is optimized for **small-screen devices**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Focus Areas

- Accurate Figma-to-code UI replication
- Mobile responsiveness across all small devices
- Support for **dark mode UI**
- Clean and organized component structure
